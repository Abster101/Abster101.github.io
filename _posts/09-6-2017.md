#Notes on my First time leading lab sections as a graduate student. 

While I have been a Teacher Assistant (TA) before in undergrad this was my first time leading a lab section for a group of this size at a school that I've  only been at for less than two weeks. My previous experiences have been for smaller class sizes where I myself have been in those classes before. Luckily enough I’ve experience TA-ing for the lab sections that I’m responsible for now, Introduction to Computer Science I, while in undergrad and assisting my sister to learn some programming skills. While we used Java in my Intro courses I’m happy to have these classes use Python, a language that I have being using for the last two years. 

Obvious enough to say that I was a bit nervous, but more than anything I was really excited to be in the front of a classroom. Before going into both my morning and evening lab sections I tried to channel in all of the great teachers and professors that I have had prior to do my best to emulate their glow. There was a lot to cover on our first lab section due to the fact that last week's lab was cancelled due to possible flooding caused by hurricane harvey that was passing by. Since there was a lot to cover I talked more at the front of the class than I think I will normally be doing but surprisingly time went by fairly quickly in both the morning and evening sections. I’m looking forward to what the future sessions will bring.
